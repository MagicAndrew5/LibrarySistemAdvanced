🔧 Local Startup 

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## 🏗️ Build & Test

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
ng test
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## 🔗 Backend Comunication

The frontend communicates with the backend via REST API on `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`

## 💡 Additional Notes 

- Add `frontend/node_modules/` to your `.gitignore`.
